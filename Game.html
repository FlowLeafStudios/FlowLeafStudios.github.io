    <h4 class="ui header">We are currently working on multiplayer tower-defence game that involved rousource management and fun interation among players.<br><br>
    One day, aliens came to the earth and destroy the entire vegetation except for the giant mother plant. <br>
    Soon after, brave soldiers with specialized skills binded up and stood up for defending the aliens, in hope they can someday restore their plants. 
    <br>Only hope is to kill aliens, take back their resources, and then heal the mother plant that also gives powers to the soldiers.
    <br>You, as a player, have to interact and colaborate with your team mate to kill all the aliens so that the mother plant can florish once again.
